Any problem that can be solved recursively,can also solved iteratively
however,some problem are best suited to be solved using recursion 
for example , tower of hanaoi ,fibonacci series, factoril finding etc.

fibonacci :-0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
In mathematical terms, each number 𝐹(𝑛)F(n) in the Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

𝐹(0)=0
F(0)=0
𝐹(1)=1
F(1)=1
𝐹(𝑛)=𝐹(𝑛−1)+𝐹(𝑛−2)
F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2) for 𝑛>1n>1
